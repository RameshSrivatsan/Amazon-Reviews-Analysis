This folder contains two files:

#### 1. Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb

This file has all the codes that were used to understand the data sets. We performed exploratory data analysis, the results of which motivated our further work on the data.

#### 2. Feature_Extraction.ipynb

This file has all the codes that were used in implementing natural language processing tasks on the review text. Ultimately, we extracted important product features from the reviews along with their semantic orientation score. This helped us classify the features into pros and cons for the product. An overview of our process can be seen below:
