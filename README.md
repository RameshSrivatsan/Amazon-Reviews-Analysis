While reviews on e-commerce sites have been a major source of information for customers to choose products, they also tend to be too much data to digest. Topical classification and sentiment classification are proposed to be used in information classification. Several machine learning methods, such as the Na√Øve Bayes, Maximum Entropy classification, and Support Vector Machines are good approaches to solve this problem. But classical algorithms lack the ability to comprehend what a reviewer liked or disliked. Our approach focuses on the part of each review that describes features of the product using subjectivity classifiers and POS tagging, and picks out the pros and cons using semantic orientation of descriptive words.
